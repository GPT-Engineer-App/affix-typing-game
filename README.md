# affix-typing-game

I need you to write code for browser-based multiplayer game, where players take turns receiving a random affix and must type a word containing that affix. When turn begins, there is timer that is shared between players. If they will fail to do so within remaining time, they lose a life. The game should include basic features such as real-time turn-based interaction, and scoring.
technologies:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB (or another database for user data and game state)
Real-time communication: Socket.io
